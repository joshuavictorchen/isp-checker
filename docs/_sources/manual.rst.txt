Installation
============

Prerequisites:
    * Python 3.8+
    * Git 2.33+

Navigate into a directory of choice and grab the code from this repository::

    git clone https://github.com/joshuavictorchen/isp-checker.git isp-checker

``cd`` into ``isp-checker`` and install the application. Use of a venv is recommended::

    cd isp-checker
    pip install -U -e .

Basic Use
=========

Once installed, the ``ispcheck`` command can be executed from any working directory to check for ISP availability at a given address, or for a given Zillow or Trulia listing.

The program is in its early stages, and is not very robust. The command MUST be entered in one of the following forms, with no deviation. Two-liner addresses are not yet supported for manual address entry::

    ispcheck [street address], [city name], [state abbreviation], [5 digit zip code]
    - or -
    ispcheck [URL for Zillow listing]
    - or -
    ispcheck [URL for Trulia listing]

For example::

    ispcheck 123 neutronland road, reactorville, nc 12345
